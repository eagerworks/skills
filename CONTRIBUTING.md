# Contributing to eagerworks/skills

`eagerworks/skills` is a collection of portable markdown agent skills — not a runnable library. Contributions improve the quality and accuracy of the guidance agents receive. Every improvement, no matter how small, benefits anyone who uses these skills.

## What you can contribute

- **Content fixes** — corrections to any skill's `SKILL.md` or `references/*.md` file (outdated commands, wrong flags, missing gotchas)
- **New reference content** — coverage gaps in an existing skill
- **Annotated assets** — additions or updates to a skill's `assets/` (config templates, executable samples)
- **Eval cases** — new test cases under `evals/<skill>/evals.json` that verify a skill answers questions correctly
- **A new skill** — see [Adding a new skill](#adding-a-new-skill) below
- **Clarity** — rewriting confusing sections, fixing typos, improving code comments

## Project structure

See [`README.md`](README.md) for the full layout. Each skill is a self-contained directory under `skills/<name>/`, and the key design principle (illustrated here with `kamal`) is the same for every skill:

- **`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`** is the hub and agent entrypoint — keep it lean. If something is detailed or niche, it belongs in `references/`.
- **`skills/<name>/references/*.md`** files are loaded on demand — each covers a single domain in depth. Add detail here rather than expanding `SKILL.md`.
- **`skills/<name>/assets/`** holds copyable starter files — templates and executable samples.
- **`skills/<name>/README.md`** is the human-facing overview of the skill.
- **`skills/<name>/CHANGELOG.md`** is the per-version history of what changed — shipped, since it's how a repo that already installed this skill finds out what's different and what it needs to update.
- **`evals/<name>/evals.json`** is the repo-level test harness — question/answer pairs used to verify quality (kept outside `skills/<name>/` so it isn't shipped to users).

## Adding a new skill

1. Create `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` with `name` and `description` frontmatter, plus a `metadata.version: "1.0.0"` field. The `description` is what agents match against — be specific about *when* to use the skill.
2. Add `references/` and `assets/` inside `skills/<name>/` as needed; keep `SKILL.md` lean and push depth into `references/`.
3. Add a `skills/<name>/README.md` human overview.
4. Add `skills/<name>/CHANGELOG.md` with an initial `[1.0.0]` entry (see [Versioning & changelogs](#versioning--changelogs) below).
5. Add eval cases at `evals/<name>/evals.json`.
6. Add a row to the **Available skills** table in [`README.md`](README.md).

## Versioning & changelogs

Every skill carries a semver `metadata.version` in `SKILL.md`'s frontmatter and a `CHANGELOG.md`. Bump the version and add a changelog entry, in the same commit, whenever a change to `SKILL.md`, `references/`, or `assets/` would be visible to someone who already installed the skill:

- **patch** (`1.0.0` → `1.0.1`) — a correction with no behavior or config change: a wrong command, an outdated flag, a typo.
- **minor** (`1.0.0` → `1.1.0`) — new optional behavior, a new optional config key, new reference coverage. Backward compatible — nothing that already worked stops working.
- **major** (`1.0.0` → `2.0.0`) — a config key renamed or removed, a default behavior flipped, or a new file the consumer must create for the skill to keep working.

Every changelog entry that touches `.eagerworks/<name>.json` (or requires creating/editing any other file in the consumer's repo) says so explicitly under a **Config** heading — for example "new optional key `foo.bar`, default `x`" or "requires creating `docs/loops/`". Never leave that to be inferred from the entry's prose or from the diff. Follow the format already used in any `skills/*/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Content guidelines

**Version accuracy.** The skill defaults to Kamal 2.x. Kamal 1.9.x content belongs exclusively in `skills/kamal/references/kamal-v1.md`. When adding examples that only apply to one version, mark them clearly:

```yaml
# Kamal 2.x only
proxy:
  ssl: true

# Kamal 1.x only (traefik block)
traefik:
  args:
    entryPoints.web.address: ":80"
```

**Good/bad config convention.** Use `✅ correct` / `❌ wrong` to contrast valid and invalid config — consistent with the existing gotchas section in `SKILL.md`.

**No real secrets.** Use placeholder values in all examples — `your-token`, `ghcr.io/your-org/your-app`, `192.168.0.1`, `your.domain.com`. Never include real credentials, registry tokens, or server addresses. The skill itself teaches users to keep secrets out of version control; examples must model that.

**Code blocks for everything.** Wrap all commands, config snippets, and file content in fenced code blocks with the appropriate language tag (`bash`, `yaml`, `ruby`, etc.).

## Testing your changes

### Eval cases

Each skill's `evals/<name>/evals.json` (e.g. `evals/kamal/evals.json`) contains question/answer pairs for automated evaluation. When your change alters skill behavior or adds new coverage, add a corresponding eval case:

```json
{
  "question": "How do I run a one-off command inside a running Kamal 2 container?",
  "answer": "Use `kamal app exec -i \"bash\"` for an interactive shell, or `kamal app exec \"your-command\"` for a non-interactive run. Add `--reuse` to reuse the existing container instead of starting a new one."
}
```

### Manual sanity check

Load the updated skill in an agent (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) and ask questions that exercise your changes. Verify the agent cites correct commands and config for the right Kamal version.

## Commit & PR process

1. **Branch from `main`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b docs/fix-rolling-deploy-example
   ```

2. **Commit with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)** — matching the project's existing history:
   - `docs:` — content changes to `SKILL.md`, `references/`, or `assets/`
   - `feat:` — new reference files, new asset templates, significant new coverage
   - `fix:` — corrections to wrong or outdated information
   - `chore:` — eval cases, project-level housekeeping

   ```bash
   git commit -m "docs: add missing --skip-push flag to cheatsheet"
   ```

3. **Open a PR against `main`** on [`eagerworks/skills`](https://github.com/eagerworks/skills). In the PR description, briefly explain what changed and why — a sentence or two is fine.

4. **Reference issues** when applicable: `Closes #12` or `See #8`.
